    <h2>How Long To Cook CHicken Breast</h2>
    <p>Cooking chicken breast in the oven couldn't be simpler. Bake the marinated chicken at 375 degrees F for about 45
        minutes, or until it reaches an internal temp of 165 degrees F. The juices should run clear and the flesh should
        be perfectly tender with no pink at the bone.
